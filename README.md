# Retail Data Cleaning and Pivot Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a retail sales dataset that initially contained inconsistent data formats, missing values, duplicate entries, and formatting irregularities across multiple columns. The raw dataset posed challenges such as inconsistent date formats, names with extra spaces and varied capitalization, and missing critical values that hindered accurate analysis and reporting. Using Microsoft Excel, I meticulously consolidated, cleaned, and standardized the dataset to enhance data quality, consistency, and integrity, preparing it for reliable analysis and visualization. In addition to data cleaning, the project includes comprehensive **PivotTable-based analysis** to uncover key insights into product performance, customer behavior, seasonal trends, city-wise distribution, and discount patterns. These summaries support actionable business recommendations across sales, marketing, product, and fulfillment strategies.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning and Pivot Tables)
- Power Query (for date parsing and transformation)
---

## Cleaning Process

### Initial Data
The dataset consisted of a single table containing 10 columns, with multiple data quality issues including missing values, inconsistent text formatting, inconsistent date formats (some dates were stored as text or General format instead of proper Date format), and duplicate rows.

### Data Cleaning & Standardization Steps
1. **Standardizing Customer Names**
   - Trimmed extra spaces and unified name casing.
   - Replaced 12 missing names with `"Na"` placeholder.

2. **Handling Missing Products**
   - Replaced 30 missing product names with `"Na"`.

3. **Fixing Quantity Format**
   - Converted all quantity values from words (e.g., ‚ÄúTwo‚Äù) to numeric values (e.g., `2`) for 1990 rows.

4. **Date Standardization**
   - Used Excel parsing functions to convert all dates to `DD/MM/YYYY` format.
   - Supported formats like `2024-10-15`, `14-Aug-2024`, and `03/04/2025`.

5. **Location Name Cleanup**
   - Standardized city names using a reference table and `XLOOKUP`, resolving abbreviations like `LA`, `Chi-Town`, and `SF`.

6. **Fixing Payment Method Inconsistencies**
   - Replaced 12 missing values with `"Na"`.
   - Standardized capitalization (e.g., `paypal` ‚Üí `PayPal`) for 1003 records.

7. **Adding New Calculated Columns**
   - `Sales = Quantity √ó Price`
   - `Net Sales = Quantity √ó Price √ó (1 - Discount%)`

## Recommendations
### 1. Sales Trend Optimization
- Boost November Performance: November is the lowest net sales month. Launch aggressive sales events like Black Friday flash deals and ‚ÄúBuy More, Save More‚Äù offers to reverse the dip.
- Pre-April Campaigns: April ranks highest in net sales‚Äîtest pre-spring exclusives or loyalty-first launches in March to build momentum.
- Created Monthly Email Calendar: Align discount depth with seasonal trends. Use a rotating monthly schedule (e.g., % off in slow months, bundles in peak months).
- Retargeting Strategy: Reactivate low-engagement months via Meta/Google ads that promote high-appeal products like Blender and Jeans.
---

### 2. Product Line Optimization
- Upsell High Revenue Products: Promote Blender, Jeans, and Watch using tiered bundles, seasonal kits, or influencer tutorials (especially for Blender).
- Address Low Net Margin Items: Products like Smartphone show high discounts. Consider revising pricing or bundling with low-cost accessories to protect margin.

---

### 3. Customer Retention & Growth
- Reward High-Value Customers: Jason Bond and Dillon King lead in net sales. Target your top 5% of customers with VIP campaigns and early-bird promos.
- Maximize Customer Lifetime Value: Use average net sales data to offer subscription-like product refreshes (e.g., biannual clothing bundles).
- Revive Lapsed Buyers: Identify one-time buyers from Jan‚ÄìMar and create personalized email flows offering discounts based on prior items.

---

### 4. City-Focused Marketing
- Double Down on New York: NY leads in product volume and net sales. Offer same-day shipping, city-specific promo codes, and pickup points to reinforce dominance.
- Expand in Houston & Chicago: These cities show strong product diversity but lower totals‚Äîtest ‚ÄúFree Shipping Week‚Äù or local influencer collabs.
- Geo-Test Bundled Discounts: Launch combo offers (e.g., Watch + Jeans) in Los Angeles to drive higher order values.
---

### 5. Discount Strategy
- Limit Blanket Discounts: With average discounts hovering around 8%, reserve high discounts for low-performing products. 
- Run ‚ÄúLimited Quantity‚Äù Drops: T-shirt and Smartphone categories should feature exclusive short-run discounts to create urgency.
